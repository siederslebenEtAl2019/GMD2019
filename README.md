# GMD2019
This repository contains the WRF configuration files necessary to reproduce the simulations as described in Siedersleben et al. 2019

The file windturbinesGMD.txt contains the locations of all windturbines implemented in the simulations. The corresponding
attributes of each wind turbine type is described in the wind-turbine-xx.tbl. Be aware that all windturbines use the same 
power and thrust coefficients only the different hub heights and rotor diameters are taken into account as described in 
Siedersleben et al. (2019).
